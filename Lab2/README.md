Completed the compulsory part
Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have (at least) the following classes: 
        Event, Room.

The start and end time will be integers. The rooms will also have the property type. The available types will be implemented as an enum .   

The toString method form the Object class must be properly overridden for all the classes.


Created and printed on the screen the objects in the example.


Completed the Homework
I created multiple packages like algorithm, event, room
Room and Algorithm are abstract classes so that I can create
different Labsoratories and different Algorithms like Greedy alg, 
DSatur etc
Created a really basic algorithm to show how it might work
